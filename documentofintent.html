        <p>This is tough.  Choosing colors displays and stuff to make things move I can do.
        Choosing content seems to be a bit tougher.  I've been working on <a href="http://www.ourladyofthesnow.org/">www.ourladyofthesnow.org</a> 
        and <a href="http://auburnweedsportcatholicchurches.org/">auburnweedsportcatholicchurches.org</a>.  I'm particularly
        proud of the hover function on the images and buttons.  Like blackboard you can write html but you don't have control
        of the style sheets so I had to add style in the html code.  Anyway, if you right click and "view source" you'll see.                </p>

          <p>I've been getting into taking apart other people's websites. A useful tool has been the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/">"inspect"</a> feature in Chrome</p>

        <p>I used Chromes inspect tool to do some fine tuning styling to this page.  Check out my screenshot</p>

		  <p>Its funny I've been struggling to get a github account set up and it appears in the chapter 9.  You have to load your repository 
			  as "username.github.io" which lets you have the free website.  I thought it was really confusing.  
			  Anyway here's my <a href="https://brabantonline.github.io/">unfinished website.</a></p> 
		  <p>I've been dabbling with wordpress a bit and I might end up loading my blog on there (which is a bunch of emptiness)</p>

			  Discovered <a href="https://codepen.io">codePen.io</a>.  I haven't really worked on it yet.  But from what I understand 
			  you can code html, css and javascript all within a webpage and it can update and run on the right.  I'm not sure
			  what it's like to download your work as to whether they make it difficult so you pay for one of the pro services.  
			  Looks like they make templates that start with them all tied together to save you from linking the documents.
			  I'm not sure if they pass validation yet.

		  <h3>Update from November 12th, 2017</h3>
		  <p> I probably should have made new posts at the top as this is beginning to get a bit like a blog.  I mean who's going to be down here.  
			  Anyway, I've been working with rgba() for my coloring.  My mozilla firefox is able to pul the color through the inspect feature in hex
			  and I've been using <a href="http://hex2rgba.devoth.com/">Hex 2 RGBA</a> to convert so I can also controll the opacity (the <bold>a</bold> in rgba).
			  I ran into <a href="https://codepen.io/CiTA/pen/BdoaQb"> a site on codepen</a> that used radial-gradient as a background and when inspected using mozilla
			  is appears as radial gradient with two rgba colors that it goes between.
		  </p>
		  <p>If you're looking at the CSS (it may be the middle column) codepen code, it appears they're using SASS or SCSS which I believe is a little different 
			  than CSS.
			  If you go to the top it has variables they use so they don't have to repeat themes.  This way you can quickly make changes.  I only know because
			  at the beginning of the semester I struggled to make sense of SASS through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a>. If you inspect 
			  the elements with you're webrowser you'll be able to get the code required to emulate.
